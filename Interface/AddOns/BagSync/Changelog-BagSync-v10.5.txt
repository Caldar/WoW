--------------------

Xruptor:
	- Bug fixes and new config options -Added a new option to replace Server names in the tooltips with astricks. -Added a new option to shorten the server names in the tooltips. -Fixed a bug where the gold display tooltip was not using class colors. -Changed a few of the locale text.  I want to start using the XR and BNET tags to reference cross-realm and battle.net features.  It makes it easier when making config options.
	- Trying new approach to cross-realm guild issue.
	- Cross-Realm guild fix and new option -Added an option to remove the XR and BNET identifiers in the tooltips. -Fixed an issue where if a person had characters within the same group of connected realms, it would cause issues with the guild count.  That's because although they are in the same guild within the connected realms, they are still on separate servers. So in order to compensate for this, it's best just not to add any realm identifiers to guilds within the same connected-realm group.
