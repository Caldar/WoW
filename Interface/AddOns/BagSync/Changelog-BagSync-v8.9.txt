--------------------

Xruptor:
	- Added Cross-Realm / BNet support to Search Window -Slowly but surely.  Had to change a local function to global for obvious reasons. -The @ commands only still work for the current logged in character.  Such as @bank or @void etc...
	- German Locals Update -Updated German localization by GrimPala at wowinterface.com (THANKS! :D)
	- DOH! A typo.... lol
	- Cleanup of DB functions -Some cleanup of the DB functions -Added some independent functions to handle same filtering process
	- Gold Tooltip Update Bah gonna commit this but I'm going to approach this a different way.
Alexander Hess:
	- FIX: GetInboxItem() change in 7.0.3
	Return parameters of GetInboxItem() have changed in 7.0.3
	
	Instead of returning name, itemTexture, count, quality, canUse the function now returns name, itemID, itemTexture, count, quality, canUse
